In order to test sample projects yout need an access key. Your can register an create anew one in [Join Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/join)

To test initial project just replace the placeholder in class UnplashClient:

```swift
private let apikey_unsplash = "UNSPLASH ACCESS KEY"
```

To test final sample project, the slides information maybe is useful:

- You must create a container in CloudKit
- Create a new record type. Named it "ApiKeys"
- Add a field to new record type created. Named it "unplash"
- Add a new recor with your api unsplash access key.

After this steps you must replace this  with real values in class ApiKeyManager:

```swift
let ckRecordId = "CLOUDKIT RECORD ID"

```
